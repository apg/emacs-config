;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple presentation mode for Emacs.  It works best in
;; Emacs 23, which has nicer font rendering.

;; To use, invoke epresent-run-frame in an outline-mode buffer.  This
;; will make a full-screen frame.  Use n/p to navigate, or q to quit.
;; (There are some other key bindings too.)  Some special markup is
;; available as well:

;;   "#" marks a comment line
;;   "* @Something" means that this outline node starts a new page
;;   "@toc" by itself on a line means to insert a table-of-contents here
;;   "[File Text]" means insert FILE as an image, with TEXT underneath
;;   "=Text=" means to format text using a mono font, useful for code

;; Probably this should be redone as a muse back end, using muse
;; markup instead.
